# Getting Started with HERZ

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Two ways to start the project 
## If it’s deployed on local host :
- Open the project 
- open terminal
- enter in your client folder by using “ cd client “ 
- run command “ npm start “ 
- then open a new terminal 
- enter in your server folder 
### By using “ cd server “ 
- run command “ npm run devStart” 
- session will be started 

## it’s already deployed on heroku: 
- open google 
- search for https://zeadhaniclient.herokuapp.com/
- session will automatically start with a new id
